  <h2>Our Work</h2>

  <p>
    At LAYER, our work reflects our belief that good design is not just about
    aesthetics — it’s about clarity, usability, and purpose. Every project we
    take on is approached with a deep understanding of the brand, its audience,
    and the business goals behind it.
  </p>

  <p>
    We focus on creating digital experiences that feel intuitive, visually
    balanced, and strategically sound. From typography choices to layout
    structure, every detail is carefully considered to ensure the final product
    communicates trust and professionalism.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a digital design studio, we work primarily on websites and user
    interfaces, combining clean design with modern frontend development. Our
    process is collaborative and transparent — ensuring clients feel involved
    and confident throughout the journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether it’s a small business website or a detailed UI layout, our goal
    remains the same: to create digital solutions that are functional, scalable,
    and aligned with the brand’s long-term vision.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>How We Approach Projects</h2>

  <p>
    Every project at LAYER follows a structured yet flexible workflow. We begin
    with research and understanding — identifying the brand’s strengths, target
    audience, and core objectives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once the foundation is clear, we move into design exploration. This includes
    wireframes, layout planning, and visual direction to ensure the experience
    feels intentional and cohesive.
  </p>

  <p>
    After finalizing the design, we focus on clean frontend development using
    modern HTML, CSS, and best practices. Performance, responsiveness, and
    accessibility are always prioritized.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, we test, refine, and deliver a polished product that is ready to
    represent the brand confidently in the digital space.

<!-- ===== VALUES SECTION ===== -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Design Principles We Follow</h2>

  <p>
    • Clarity over complexity — designs should be easy to understand and use.  
  </p>
  <p>
    • Purpose-driven visuals — every design element must serve a reason.  
  </p>
  <p>
    • Consistency — visual harmony builds trust and recognition.  
  </p>
  <p>
    • Scalability — designs should grow with the brand.  
  </p>
